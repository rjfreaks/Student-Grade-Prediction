# Project desciption:
* The Student Grade Prediction project is designed to assist schools and educational institutions in predicting a student's final academic performance based on a variety of influencing factors. By analyzing student demographics, parental education levels, previous grades, and other contextual features, this project builds a predictive model that can estimate a student’s final grade.

* The primary objective is to help institutions identify students at risk of underperforming early in the academic cycle, enabling them to provide timely interventions, personalized learning resources, and academic support before it’s too late.

* This project not only demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in the education sector but also highlights how data-driven decision-making can improve student outcomes and overall institutional performance.

# Key Features:

* Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on student performance and demographic factors.
* Feature Engineering to select the most impactful predictors.
* Machine Learning Models applied to predict final grades.
* Model Evaluation using appropriate accuracy metrics.
* Business-friendly Presentation explaining results, value, and insights.

# Technologies Used:

* Python (Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn)
* Jupyter Notebook
* CSV Dataset
* PDF for stakeholder presentation

# Results & Insights

The model successfully identifies students at risk of underperforming based on:

Prior academic performance
Parental education level
Demographics
Other contextual factors
By using this model, schools can intervene early and provide necessary support before it’s too late.
