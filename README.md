Project desciption:
* The Student Grade Prediction project is designed to assist schools and educational institutions in predicting a student's final academic performance based on a variety of influencing factors. By analyzing student demographics, parental education levels, previous grades, and other contextual features, this project builds a predictive model that can estimate a student‚Äôs final grade.

The primary objective is to help institutions identify students at risk of underperforming early in the academic cycle, enabling them to provide timely interventions, personalized learning resources, and academic support before it‚Äôs too late.

This project not only demonstrates the practical application of machine learning in the education sector but also highlights how data-driven decision-making can improve student outcomes and overall institutional performance.
